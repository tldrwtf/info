# Glossary of Terms

This glossary defines key terms and acronyms used throughout the Full Stack Learning Hub.

## A
*   **API (Application Programming Interface):** A set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.
*   **Asynchronous:** A programming pattern where operations can occur independently of the main program flow, allowing tasks to run in the background (e.g., JavaScript `async/await`).

## B
*   **Blueprint (Flask):** A way to organize a group of related views and other code. Blueprints register operations on an application later when they are registered on the application.
*   **Bootstrap:** A popular CSS framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.

## C
*   **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment):** A method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development.
*   **CRUD:** Acronym for the four basic operations of persistent storage: **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete.

## D
*   **DOM (Document Object Model):** The data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web.
*   **Decorator (Python):** A design pattern in Python that allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure.

## E
*   **Endpoint:** A specific URL where an API receives requests (e.g., `GET /users`).

## F
*   **Flask:** A micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.
*   **Frontend:** The part of a website or application that the user interacts with directly (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

## G
*   **Git:** A distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
*   **GitHub Actions:** A CI/CD platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline.

## H
*   **HTTP Methods:** Verbs used in HTTP requests to indicate the desired action (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH).

## J
*   **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):** A lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.
*   **JWT (JSON Web Token):** A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.

## M
*   **Marshmallow:** A library for converting complex data types, such as objects, to and from native Python data types (serialization/deserialization).
*   **MVC (Model-View-Controller):** An architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller.

## O
*   **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping):** A technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. SQLAlchemy is the ORM used in this project.
*   **OpenAPI:** A specification for building APIs (formerly known as Swagger).

## R
*   **REST (Representational State Transfer):** An architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web.
*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## S
*   **SQLAlchemy:** The Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.
*   **Schema:** The organization or structure for a database or API response.

## V
*   **Virtual Environment (venv):** A self-contained directory tree that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus a number of additional packages.

## W
